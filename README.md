# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Introduction:

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions, resulting in billions of dollars in losses annually. Timely detection of fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Project Description:

The objective of this project is to design and implement a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. The model will utilize a dataset containing historical transaction data, including features such as:

- Transaction amount
- Transaction location
- Time of transaction
- Card information (e.g., card type, expiration date)
- User information (e.g., age, location)


Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize/standardize features, and convert categorical variables into numerical variables.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as transaction velocity, average transaction amount, and card usage patterns.

3. Model Selection: Experiment with supervised learning algorithms, including:

    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Neural Networks
